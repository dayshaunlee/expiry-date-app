# Expiry Date Tracking System
## What is the purpose of this tool?
This application will be for tracking expiry dates for various sorts of food. Often there is a lot of food left in the fridge or pantry and people forget when they bought it. As I have to make food for myself, I want to have healthy eating habits. Searching for expiry dates can be a hassle, not to mention food packaging that has been thrown out entirely--expiry date included. Food may get thrown out when one is on the fence of whether it's safe to eat, so having an effective way of tracking expiry dates can save money as well. **Eating expired food can not only make you feel uncomfortable/sick but can be unsafe**.

For products like fresh vegetables, they may not necessarily have expiry dates but the date purchased can be tracked along with an _estimated_ "expiry date". This tool can be used by anyone storing food in their house. By using this tool, it saves time, money, and promotes safety.

## What are the benefits?
